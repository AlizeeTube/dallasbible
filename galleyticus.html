         <h3>THE SECOND BOOK OF DALLAS, CALLED</h3>
         <h1>GALLEYTICUS</h1>

         <h3><i>The Galleytian Paradise</i></h3>

      <p>1 In the sky, Dallas made the Galleytian Paradise a place of eternal pleasure and reward, a sanctuary for those who go and support His friends’ streams</p>

      <p>2 For Dallas has visited me in my erotic dreams, and shown me the river of cum, bright as crystal, rich with the backed up testicular produce from years of no release.</p>
      <p>3 And all the believers who were gifted with second life in Paradise were blessed with one BTC each, for the Worm was wealthy and did not care about material extravagance.</p>
      <p>4 He made this obvious very often and without prompt: “I’m very rich Emily I have a lot of money most of the money I have I help others Like my mom is struggling currently yesterday payed my moms rent & her debt off I am a really good person”</p>
      <p>5 Though with all this wealth, the nonbelievers wondered, “Why do you never donate any of your plentiful wealth to your desired female streamers whom you claim to care about? </p>
      <p>6 Why do you work at a minimum wage call center job and describe it as decent income when you have so much wealth?</p>
      <p>7 Do you even have a job? Who gets a promotion in the first month, and two more after that in the span of four months?”</p>
      <p>8 But whenever the Worm was questioned in chat, He would stare with lifeless gaze for ten seconds and then change the subject. For He needed to deliver no explanation, the Worm would never lie.</p>

      <p>9 For those who live and breathe a righteous, selfless, and virtuous life in the same manner as Dallas, He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</p> 
      <p>10 “No longer will there be anything accursed”, said Dallas “but only the blessing of not seventy two, but one blonde virgin in Paradise”. For they were objects in the eyes of the Worm, mere playthings made for pleasure.</p>

      <p>1 And those that were denied access to the Galleytian paradise, Dallas sent to the underworld, a burning furnace ruled by the Devil Jon Zherka that he created for sinners to suffer for eternity</p>
      <p>2 For Dallas punished those who were not as virtuous as He: the promiscuous men who failed to save themselves for the one, the uncaring men who did not respect women as he did, the gays and the colored.</p>
      <p>3 Their souls, stripped of their corporeal form are dragged into the fiery depths of Galleytian Hell. </p>
      <p>4 “The immoral —they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur” Dallas proclaimed. This is the second death.</p>
      <p>5 In this furnace of eternal fire, the Worm’s original songs are played through a loudspeaker - an endless playlist of songs in the Dallas-3 scale, an unforgiving fate that Dallas deemed worthy for these wicked souls.</p>
