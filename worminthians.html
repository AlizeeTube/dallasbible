         <h3>THE THIRD BOOK OF DALLAS, CALLED</h3>
         <h1>WORMINTHIANS</h1>
         <h2><b>CHAPTER 1</b></h2>
         <h3><i>The Year of the Worm</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 In the rectum of the earth, which was given the moniker “Arizona”, the Worm Dallas was born in the year 1994 AD to the Galley family, a very long lateral bloodline that consisted of one mother, and many step fathers and step siblings.</p>
      <p>2 “I am born of the womb of Brittany Galley and of the seed of the whole football team” and so He was.</p>
      <p>3 In human form, Dallas embodied supernatural, unrestricted power. He expressed His awe-some godliness through voice acting and spent childhood teaching His subjects the art of voice acting at His personal Arizonian temple.</p>
      <p>4 “If you were, for instance, to be challenged with the task of doing a voice impression”, He explained to His disciples, “You must make your voice slightly lower and say that you are the subject whom you are impersonating”.</p> 
      <p>5 “I am vengeance, I am the night, I am batman”, He acted with meticulous and uncanny accuracy. </p>
      <p>6 And perfect too was He in the realm of pitch. For Dallas was so skilled with His voice that he could do anything he wished with it.</p>
      <p>7 So Dallas was capable of singing any song request with great precision as long as it was written solely with the D note in the third octave of the twelve tone musical system.</p>

      <p>8 “I have come to you with an original ballad written by none other than Myself” Dallas proclaimed in a crowded pub. </p>
      <p>9 And the onlookers looked with a loud curiosity and asked the Worm “What have you named this melody?”</p>
      <p>10 And Dallas said the name of His Song, “I title it ‘Dark Thoughts’”</p>
      <p>11 The ballad was thus sung as such:</p>
               
      </br>
      </br>
      <p><i>“These dark thoughts in my mind won’t go away</i></p>
      <p><i>It’s not clear who’s to blame</i></p>
      <p><i>What can I say? </i></p>
      <p><i>My mind is just full of empty regrets</i></p>
      <p><i>How can I make these dark thoughts go away?</i></p>
      <p><i>What can I do to change my mind?</i></p>
      <p><i>What can I say to make you stay?</i></p>
      <p><i>These dark thoughts are consuming my mind</i></p>
      <p><i>How can I change what’s happening inside?</i></p>
      <p><i>Can you help me?</i></p>
      <p><i>Can you help me?</i></p>
      <p><i>Can you help me change my mind?</i></p>
      <p><i>These dark thoughts are fogging up my mind</i></p>
      <p><i>Can you help me?</i></p>
      <p><i>Can you help me?</i></p>
      <p><i>Can you help me change my mind?”</i></p>

      <p>1  And in His childhood, He explored His sexuality at a young age, having many romantic encounters, mainly with men. </p>
      <p>2 The most prominent of these instances realized its fruition at a birthday party in which He played football with His strong and healthy body.</p>
      <p>3 Dallas recalls with confidence, “I was running to catch the ball. I went face first into another dude and my lips met his”</p>
      <p>4 Dallas continued to have many of these romantic homosexual encounters throughout His childhood.</p>
      <p>5 This was how He made His revelation, for Dallas has proclaimed “I am not gay, I know because I have kissed several men and didn’t like it. By continuing to kiss many men on several different occasions, I made sure that I wasn’t gay.”</p>
      <p>6 In His erotic dreams, Dallas dreamt of a fantasy that reality would never match.</p>
      <p>7 Because Dallas was 100% heterosexual, He indulged in erotic dreams exclusively about being pegged by his female friends, a subject which he spoke of often, publicly</p>

      <p>8 Draw close to Dallas in your hour of prayer and recite: “These egirls, who art in Austin, hallowed be thy names; thy kingdom come; thy will be done in my dreams as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our nightly emission; and plunge my ass like a clogged toilet; and lead us not into homosexuality, but deliver us from evil. Gaymen.”</p>
      <p>9 “Hails Bee, Hail, Bee! Full of grace, the Worm is with thee. Blessed are thou among woman, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. Holy Hailsbee, Egirl of Galley, pray for us virgins, now, and at the hour of our dreams. Gaymen. ”</p>
      <p>10 “O Dallas, grant me the serenity to accept that I’m a loser, the honesty to write in my public diary, and the love that I long for. Gaymen.”</p>
      <p>11 “I believe in the #one, the Egirl almighty, maker of erotic dreams, of all things blonde and white. I believe in the #one, the Only Begotten One for Me, born of the love I desire Pleading Face. For us men and for our salvation she comes down from heaven, and became ours, and by the Holy Egirl was incarnate of the Virgin Hailsbee, and became ours. Gaymen.”</p>
