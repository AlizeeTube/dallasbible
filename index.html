         <h3>THE FIRST BOOK OF DALLAS, CALLED</h3>
         <h1>GALLEYSIS</h1>
         <h2><b>CHAPTER 1</b></h2>
         <h3><i>The Beginning</i></h3>
      
      <p><font size="20">I</font>n the beginning Brittany Galley gave birth to the nine celestial bodies, all from different fathers</p>
      
      <p>2 Now the earth was formless and empty, brunettes were over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of Brittany was hovering over the waters.</p>

      <p>3 Brittany took a worm from the soil of the Earth and molded the larva’s form into that of a handsome baby boy</p>
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/brittany.png" alt="Brittany">
      </div>
      
      <p>4 Brittany saw that her handsome son, whom she named Dallas, did not like the darker colors and she said, “Let there be blondes” and there were blondes.</p>
      
      <p>5 Dallas saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the melanin.</p> 
      <p>6 Dallas wanted to have sex with the blondes, for they reminded Him of His mother. He called the blondes “the one” and the darkness He called “not His type.”</p>

      <p>7 Then Dallas created a Twitter, in the image of Galley He created it; public and honest He created His diary.</p> 
      <p>8 Dallas blessed it and said through it, “I never delete tweets Twitter is my diary let me be me”</p> 
      
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/diary.png" alt="Diary">
      </div>
      
      <p>9 Then Brittany saw that His baby boy was lonely and horny. So she directed upon the Blondes she created in her image: “Ladies, go and make Twitch accounts, baptizing weak men in the name of the Worm and of the One and of the Holy Blonde Women”</p>
      <p>10 Dallas saw all the women that He had access to, the women that could not escape Him, and it was very good. So, He created an account on Twitch Himself.</p>
      <p>11 The worm wrote in His declaration,</p>
      <p>“Hi My Name is Dallas. I have been a Twitch streamer since April 17, 2014. I am 28. I love to play pretty much anything. I love being a streamer because it allows me to meet great people. Right Now I am a full time streamer and aspiring actor & voice actor. I try to stream everyday and appreciate all the support, thanks for watching my channel.”</p>

         <h2>GALLEYSIS 2<h2>
         <h3><i>The One</i></h3>
      </center>

      <p>1 When Brittany gave birth to all the beings in the Universe, she distributed more testosterone into her baby boy than any other man.</p>
      <p>2 The exorbitant testosterone within Dallas manifested itself in more ways than one.</p>
      <p>3 With His gargantuan one-foot shoulder width, massive five-inch phallic member, long neck bristles, imposing 120 pound weight, high nasally voice, and ever-revealing scalp, He was a catch - a very attractive man. </p>
     
      <center>

      </center>
      <p>4 The Catch thus wondered, publicly, “Why do all the girls to which I am attracted not share the same feelings that I have confessed unto them?”</p>
      <p>5 His eye landed upon many of these women who eventually and ultimately rejected Him. These women, He collectively called “The One”</p>
      <p>6 So Dallas hunted for the singular entity with whom He was meant to be by preying on multiple women at once. </p>

      <p>7 Of these women, one revealed herself as Adrianah of the house of Lee. “A true beauty inside & out”, the worm says to Himself in His diary, publicly and frequently.</p>
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:200px" src="images/dri.png" alt="Dri">
      </div>
      <p>8 Adrianah, like His many declared crushes, was of the Aryan nature. This satisfied His Oedipus complex.</p>
      <p>9 “Yeah, I like a girl who can make me laugh,” Dallas admitted, revealing that personality mattered much to Him.</p>
      <p>10 Adrianah thus appealed to this desire, with her rich personality that consisted of many hobbies and traits: partying and drinking.</p>
      <p>11 So Dallas planted a framed portrait of His good friend Adrianah - whom He has never talked to in real life - above His place of rest.</p>
      <p>12 The nonbelievers did not like this, but Dallas did not care. “It’s not a shrine,” He proclaimed. “She is my good friend”. And so the shrine persisted.</p>
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:250px" src="images/kiss.png" alt="Kiss">
      </div>
      <p>13 And so too did Dallas persist, spreading the Good word of Himself in an attempt to win the hearts of His muses</p>
      <p>14 “So many weird woman DM me asking for sex. I am sick of it, Sorry ladies I am saving myself for someone I love” he heralds. </p>
      <p>15 And between the ages, Dallas has encountered a scenario that no man had ever found themselves in, for He was more attractive than any other man alive. His truthful account reads as such:</p>
      <p>16 “Alas there have been many beautiful woman who have brought me to their place of dwelling, and stripped to the nude before me, and I have rejected their advances. For I am a catch, and will not give my gift of bustling drive for sex to just any common wench.”</p>
      <p>17 “And alas there have been many harlots who have sent messengers to beg for my sex. Many beautiful models from the land of Insta Gram.”</p>
      <p>18 And when those who sought to challenge the great Worm did as such, the Worm retreated into the greatest defense He could raise, for he had mastered the art of self pity</p>
      <p>19 “Those who seek to challenge my reputation and My being shall be cursed to learn that I am indeed a loser. Yes, I have no friends, no one likes me.”</p>
      <p>20 And so Dallas was a master of evasion, seamlessly and effortlessly cycling between narcissistic confidence based in no material truth, and the self pity that He had become so familiar with. </p>
      <p>21 The Worm knew with excellent certainty which to use given any circumstance.</p>
      <p>22 For if He was challenged, He would mope and become a victim</p>
      <p>23 And if He was not, He would be the Hottest, Richest, most Popular Man alive, divine in His being</p>

         <h3><i>The Antithesis</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 In contrast to Dallas who was a fit, handsome, Man With A Great Voice, there too was an Antithesis.</p>
      <p>2 All the estrogen that was lacking from Dallas converged on a single entity, creating a beta male of the name Jon from the house of Zherka.</p>
      <p>3 Zherka was feeble, with near seven foot stature, dark glistening skin, solid beard, and a pathetic 200 pound muscular build. </p>
      <p>4 Adrianah of the house of Lee along with the rest of Dallas' Muses were visited often by Zherka, just to hang out probably. The worm thought nothing of it.</p>

      <p>5 Dallas merely exclaims, “Nothing needs to be photoshopped about Adrianah she is a pure beauty ;)”  </p>

         <h3><i>The Garden Of Dri-den</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 Then the worm Dallas formed a chat from the clay of the ground and breathed into its nostrils the breath of life, and the chat became a living being.</p>
      <p>2 And the worm Dallas commanded the chat, “You are free to act and speak in any way in the garden of Dri-den; but you must not talk shit about my friends.”</p>
      <p>3 Now Flynndakota was more crafty than any of the wild animals the worm Dallas had made.</p>
      <p>4 The chat said to Flynn, “We may do anything in the chat,</p>
      <p>5 but Dallas did say, ‘You must not eat from the tree of trolling’”</p>
      <p>6 When Flynn saw that AdrianahLee had an aquarium, he suggested to Dallas “It would be in your interest to purchase a fish tank”</p>
      <p>7 The worm Dallas exploded into a fit of righteous holy fury, and banished Flynn from the Garden of Dri-den because of the act of disrespect.</p>
      <p>8 “Stop telling me to get a fish tank; you're fucking weird” the Worm proclaimed.</p>
      <p>9  After He drove Flynn out, Dallas declared in the chat “I am in charge here, do not troll me or I will ban you, I am very strong and big”.</p>
      <p>10 For Dallas hated and chastised all who were not blonde women that he wanted to have sex with </p>
      <p>11 May you have trust in the Dallas Galley way, proclaim that you are of good character, a nice guy, a man of moral excellence who strives to be kind.</p>
      <p>12 And demand a reward for your kindness and expect a return, for good people deliver only for what they will get out of it. This is the definition of being a good, kind person.</p>
      <p>13 For kindness, when you are a good person, is the fare you pay to receive the bodies of women. Give not out of the compassion of your heart, but out of your selfish desire to receive.</p>
      <p>14 And remember to pout and cry when you do not receive your entitled desires, this is the mark of a good person.</p>

      <p>15 The Worm was complacent with chat and so He blessed the world and disappeared into His Pokimane blanket for a sleep stream</p>
