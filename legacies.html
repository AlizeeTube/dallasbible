         <h3>THE FOURTH BOOK OF DALLAS, CALLED</h3>
         <h1>LEGACIES</h1>

      <p>1 In the wake of His wave across Twitch, Dallas encountered many lucky enough to be blessed with His presence.</p>
      <p>2 Of his male apostles, Mitch Jones was the closest to Him. For they were good companions; Dallas a moderator in the chat of Jones, and Jones a musician whom Dallas respected and emulated. </p>
      <p>3 “I have seen the Rat succeed in his mission to elope with all the blonde ladies in Austin, no less his success in the conquest of Adrianah Lee. I shall become desirable as such and make music of my own. Then, the blondes shall view Myself as one of the same expertise. And they will finally have feelings for Me”.</p>
      <p>4 So when the renowned bard Ko of the house of Stere put out word of his desire to collaborate with the great Worm, the worm replied:</p>
      <p>5 “Lets go Ko Stere, we gotta make something together I’m down”.</p>
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/down.png"  alt="down">
      </div>
      <p>6 Ko Stere reveled in this accomplishment, for so long had he aspired to have Dallas Galley make music with him. For Dallas to be down was unprecedented.</p>
      <p>7 Ko Stere gave word to his then current musical partner Sord of the house of Way that they would no longer be collaborating.</p>
      <p>8 “I have found a new partner, Sord Way, the great Worm is down for me to join Him in His musical ventures. He will take your place, and perform the medley of Twitch. For in my distress I called to the Worm, and He answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and Dallas listened to my cry.  To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But Dallas, my savior, brought my life up from the pit."</p>
      <p>9 So Dallas and Ko Stere made ballads that touched the hearts of every man, woman, child, young, and old. With this fame, Dallas befriended many new apostles.</p>
      <p>10 So blessed were they when the great Worm traveled the land and made His pilgrimage to the land of Austin to be closer to His many friends, including Mizkif, Mitch Jones, Adrianah Lee, and Emily CC. </p>
      <p>11 For every person whom the Worm considered to be a friend also saw the same in Him. All saw him as a good friend.</p>
      <p>12 Then His many friends prayed and said: “Our hearts rejoice in the Worm; In the Worm my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, For I delight in Your deliverance. “There is no one holy like the Worm; There is no one besides You; There is no Rock like Dallas. We thank you for moving to us so that we may be blessed everyday with your light”</p>

      <p>1 In the land of Twitch, year 2021, a band of misfits from various villages had formed a church dedicated to their god “Valorant”.</p>
      <p>2 In this church, they congregated near daily to pray to their deity.</p>
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:100px" src="images/valorant.png"  alt="valorant">
      </div>
      <p>3 However, there were those who practiced a strange and unattractive worship. These individuals, one being a very big guy, made the church an undesirable endeavor. </p>
      <p>4 So, the original founders of the church migrated from the land and made their claim on a new church. This they called “Dead Game”, a Church open to only the most desirable of followers. </p>
      <p>5 Their deity was not to be worshiped for long. For upon the founding of this church, a prominent messenger by the name of Howard of house Weh called upon the denizens of to reveal a message revealed to him by the worm Dallas Galley.</p>
      <p>6 The word of the Worm through the prophet Howard rung across the town, and he proclaimed "Hear me, hear now, for I have returned with word from the Worm Dallas Galley Himself." </p>
      <p>7 He then recited the word of the Worm: “Tried falling asleep, did for like 2 hours. Ended up waking up with my underwear soaked with cum… fuck my life. Anyway changed underwear back to sleeping emoji I go. Crossing my fingers I don’t have another erotic dream. Sometimes I wish I didn’t have a high sex drive”.</p>
      <p>8 They were speechless, gagged by the sensation of awe that overcame them.</p>
      <p>9 "That is not all I have brought" Howard said. "There is more", and so the prophet showed them the source of the Galleytian word, His personal diary.</p>
      <p>10 The members of the church accepted Howard's gift, And so, the lives that they found once without purpose became the opposite - a life and mind dedicated to the Worm Dallas Galley. The church that had once spoke the name of Valorant now spoke in the language of the Worm.</p>

         <h3><i>Cycles & Sects</i></h3>

      <p>1 As the church progressed however, there were sects that emerged from the followers.</p>
      <p>2 The church was thus divided into two denominations: those who love and laugh at the Worm, and those who despise the worm with voracious and insatiable bloodlust.</p>

      <p>3 “WE MUST CRUCIFY THE WORM, WE MUST PROTECT THIS CITY”, the haters declare. </p>
      <p>4 “DALLAS IS SO CUTE, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH”, the lovers declare. </p>
      <p>5 It is said that any given individual who participates in the teachings of the church will find their place in a sect based on which phase of worship they are in. </p>
      <p>6 The phases are as such:</p>
      </br>
      </br>
      <p>   Phase 1: The follower is in disbelief. Dallas must be a troll. </p>
      <p>   Phase 2: The follower believes that Dallas is genuine and pities Him</p>
      <p>   Phase 3: The follower returns to disbelief, unable to cope with the reality that Dallas is real</p>
      <p>   Phase 4: The follower finally accepts that Dallas is genuine. </p>
      </br>
      <p>Once the follower finds themself past phase 4, they move onto the next subset of phases which shifts its focus from belief to emotion, though there may be temporary lapses of belief and disbelief.</p>
      </br>
      <p>   Phase 5: The follower laughs at the Worm, for He is so absurd</p>
      <p>   Phase 6: The follower notices the narcissistic and pathological lying tendencies of the Worm and begins to be annoyed</p>
      <p>   Phase 7: The follower hates the worm with fiery passion</p>
      <p>   Phase 8: Mental detachment. The follower becomes obsessed with Dallas and cannot think or talk about anything except Dallas</p>
      <p>   Phase 9: The follower takes a break to return to Phase 5 or else they risk entering phase 10</p>
      <p>   Phase 10: COMPLETE INSANITY FROM WHICH THERE IS NO RETURN	</p>
      </br>
      </br>
      <p>7 Ironically, the followers of Dallas find themselves in progressive phases and evolutions when the Worm Himself displays no development.</p>
      <p>8 For it has been seen in the diary of the Worm that His simple mind is composed merely of a few mental states, countable on one hand, repeating for an eternity.</p>
      <p>9 The Worm lives in a perpetual state of narcissism and lust, cycling between these sentiments according to the alignment of the cosmic bodies.</p>
      <p>10 As the first planetary worm segment peaks its head out of the dirt into the Blonde constellation, the Worm exhibits feelings of depression and loneliness. This part of the cycle is the longest.</p>
      <p>11 Once the second worm segment begins moving into retrograde on the first inning of the Astrowormical calendar, the Worm exhibits feelings of being a hot #sexy guy.</p>
      <p>12 When the third planetary worm segment's position is at the peak of its arc, the Worm exhibits feelings of being the most W guy and vocalizes its mating call: "Sleep, eat, work, eat, work, game, sleep. REPEAT that’s my life & I love it."</p>
      <p>13 As the Worm slowly realizes that its pathetic mating call did not impress any maidens on the descent into the Loser constellation, the Worm vocalizes its exhaustion, stating that he is tired of being rejected by those that he has a crush on.</p>
      <p>14 The worm hits the bottom of its rotation in the Horny constellation, when the Worm cries about being painfully horny, having such a high sex drive, and wanting a girlfriend that he would please every single day with his 5 inch monster built for the adult industry</p>
      <p>15 And on every fifth cycle, the planetary worm segment will visit its rarest occurrence in the Quitting constellation. The worm announces that He is done with streaming in the most pathetic way at this point in the higher level cycle. Soon after, the worm's five minute memory forgets that he quit and he goes live for the whole week.</p>
