         <h3>THE FOURTH BOOK OF DALLAS, CALLED</h3>
         <h1>LEGACIES</h1>
         <h2><b>CHAPTER 1</b></h2>

      <p>1 In the wake of His wave across Twitch, Dallas encountered many lucky enough to be blessed with His presence.</p>
      <p>2 Of his male apostles, Mitch Jones was the closest to Him. For they were good companions; Dallas a moderator in the chat of Jones, and Jones a musician whom Dallas respected and emulated. </p>
      <p>3 “I have seen the Rat succeed in his mission to elope with all the blonde ladies in Austin, no less his success in the conquest of Adrianah Lee. I shall become desirable as such and make music of my own. Then, the blondes shall view Myself as one of the same expertise. And they will finally have feelings for Me”.</p>
      <p>4 So when the renowned bard Ko of the house of Stere put out word of his desire to collaborate with the great Worm, the worm replied:</p>
      <p>5 “Lets go Ko Stere, we gotta make something together I’m down”.</p>
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/down.png"  alt="down">
      </div>
      <p>6 Ko Stere reveled in this accomplishment, for so long had he aspired to have Dallas Galley make music with him. For Dallas to be down was unprecedented.</p>
      <p>7 Ko Stere gave word to his then current musical partner Sord of the house of Way that they would no longer be collaborating.</p>
      <p>8 “I have found a new partner, Sord Way, the great Worm is down for me to join Him in His musical ventures. He will take your place, and perform the medley of Twitch. For in my distress I called to the Worm, and He answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and Dallas listened to my cry.  To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But Dallas, my savior, brought my life up from the pit."</p>
      <p>9 So Dallas and Ko Stere made ballads that touched the hearts of every man, woman, child, young, and old. With this fame, Dallas befriended many new apostles.</p>
      <p>10 So blessed were they when the great Worm traveled the land and made His pilgrimage to the land of Austin to be closer to His many friends, including Mizkif, Mitch Jones, Adrianah Lee, and Emily CC. </p>
      <p>11 For every person whom the Worm considered to be a friend also saw the same in Him. All saw him as a good friend.</p>
      <p>12 Then His many friends prayed and said: “Our hearts rejoice in the Worm; In the Worm my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, For I delight in Your deliverance. “There is no one holy like the Worm; There is no one besides You; There is no Rock like Dallas. We thank you for moving to us so that we may be blessed everyday with your light”</p>

      <p>1 In the land of Twitch, year 2021, a band of misfits from various villages had formed a church dedicated to their god “Valorant”.</p>
      <p>2 In this church, they congregated near daily to pray to their deity.</p>
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:100px" src="images/valorant.png"  alt="valorant">
      </div>
      <p>3 However, there were those who practiced a strange and unattractive worship. These individuals, one being a very big guy, made the church an undesirable endeavor. </p>
      <p>4 So, the original founders of the church migrated from the land and made their claim on a new church. This they called “Dead Game”, a Church open to only the most desirable of followers. </p>
      <p>5 Their deity was not to be worshiped for long. For upon the founding of this church, a prominent messenger by the name of Howard of house Weh called upon the denizens of to reveal a message revealed to him by the worm Dallas Galley.</p>
      <p>6 The word of the Worm through the prophet Howard rung across the town, and he proclaimed "Hear me, hear now, for I have returned with word from the Worm Dallas Galley Himself." </p>
      <p>7 He then recited the word of the Worm: “Tried falling asleep, did for like 2 hours. Ended up waking up with my underwear soaked with cum… fuck my life. Anyway changed underwear back to sleeping emoji I go. Crossing my fingers I don’t have another erotic dream. Sometimes I wish I didn’t have a high sex drive”.</p>
      <p>8 They were speechless, gagged by the sensation of awe that overcame them.</p>
      <p>9 "That is not all I have brought" Howard said. "There is more", and so the prophet showed them the source of the Galleytian word, His personal diary.</p>
      <p>10 The members of the church accepted Howard's gift, And so, the lives that they found once without purpose became the opposite - a life and mind dedicated to the Worm Dallas Galley. The church that had once spoke the name of Valorant now spoke in the language of the Worm.</p>

         <h3><i>Cycles & Sects</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>1 As the church progressed however, there were sects that emerged from the followers.</p>
      <p>2 The church was thus divided into two denominations: those who love and laugh at the Worm, and those who despise the worm with voracious and insatiable bloodlust.</p>
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:750px" src="images/crucify.png"  alt="crucify">
      </div>
      <p>3 “WE MUST CRUCIFY THE WORM, WE MUST PROTECT THIS CITY”, the haters declare. </p>
      <p>4 “DALLAS IS SO CUTE, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH”, the lovers declare. </p>
      <p>5 It is said that any given individual who participates in the teachings of the church will find their place in a sect based on which phase of worship they are in. </p>
      <p>6 The phases are as such:</p>
      </br>
      </br>
      <p>   Phase 1: The follower is in disbelief. Dallas must be a troll. </p>
      <p>   Phase 2: The follower believes that Dallas is genuine and pities Him</p>
      <p>   Phase 3: The follower returns to disbelief, unable to cope with the reality that Dallas is real</p>
      <p>   Phase 4: The follower finally accepts that Dallas is genuine. </p>
      </br>
      <p>Once the follower finds themself past phase 4, they move onto the next subset of phases which shifts its focus from belief to emotion, though there may be temporary lapses of belief and disbelief.</p>
      </br>
      <p>   Phase 5: The follower laughs at the Worm, for He is so absurd</p>
      <p>   Phase 6: The follower notices the narcissistic and pathological lying tendencies of the Worm and begins to be annoyed</p>
      <p>   Phase 7: The follower hates the worm with fiery passion</p>
      <p>   Phase 8: Mental detachment. The follower becomes obsessed with Dallas and cannot think or talk about anything except Dallas</p>
      <p>   Phase 9: The follower takes a break to return to Phase 5 or else they risk entering phase 10</p>
      <p>   Phase 10: COMPLETE INSANITY FROM WHICH THERE IS NO RETURN	</p>
      </br>
      </br>
      <p>7 Ironically, the followers of Dallas find themselves in progressive phases and evolutions when the Worm Himself displays no development.</p>
      <p>8 For it has been seen in the diary of the Worm that His simple mind is composed merely of a few mental states, countable on one hand, repeating for an eternity.</p>
      <p>9 The Worm lives in a perpetual state of narcissism and lust, cycling between these sentiments according to the alignment of the cosmic bodies.</p>
      <p>10 As the first planetary worm segment peaks its head out of the dirt into the Blonde constellation, the Worm exhibits feelings of depression and loneliness. This part of the cycle is the longest.</p>
      <p>11 Once the second worm segment begins moving into retrograde on the first inning of the Astrowormical calendar, the Worm exhibits feelings of being a hot #sexy guy.</p>
      <p>12 When the third planetary worm segment's position is at the peak of its arc, the Worm exhibits feelings of being the most W guy and vocalizes its mating call: "Sleep, eat, work, eat, work, game, sleep. REPEAT that’s my life & I love it."</p>
      <p>13 As the Worm slowly realizes that its pathetic mating call did not impress any maidens on the descent into the Loser constellation, the Worm vocalizes its exhaustion, stating that he is tired of being rejected by those that he has a crush on.</p>
      <p>14 The worm hits the bottom of its rotation in the Horny constellation, when the Worm cries about being painfully horny, having such a high sex drive, and wanting a girlfriend that he would please every single day with his 5 inch monster built for the adult industry</p>
      <p>15 And on every fifth cycle, the planetary worm segment will visit its rarest occurrence in the Quitting constellation. The worm announces that He is done with streaming in the most pathetic way at this point in the higher level cycle. Soon after, the worm's five minute memory forgets that he quit and he goes live for the whole week.</p>
      </br>
      </br>
      <p> The cycle visualized, each tweet set at a different time, but falling in the same part of the Astrowormical Zodiac Calendar:</p>

         <h2>LEGACIES 4<h2>
         <h3><i>The Slug</i></h3>

      <p>1 As time proceeded and the church grew, the Musician Ko Stere put his trust in those whom he had befriended from outside the Church.
      <p>2 “Join our church, dear friends, we participate in merry game and competition in our community. And observe, dear friends; find amusement in the Worm and his splendor,” Ko Stere would tell his new recruits.
      <p>3 Of these new goers, most understood the way of the Church, finding their place in it comfortably and partaking in regular religious practice.
      <p>4 As Ko Stere spread to new lands in his quest to recruit more disciples, he recruited from many communities, pulling from his own land, and even from far reaches such as Mizkif’s kingdom.
      <p>5 And it was with the Mizkif Goggles that he obtained from this kingdom that he recruited from the Normans of the Norman Kingdom. 
      <p>6 “My dear Norman friends, Trendan and Corey, I invite you to our church, a community of like-minded individuals who find great delight in our religious endeavors”
      <p>7 And so the Normans joined the church. But alas, they were met with a hidden skepticism on behalf of the Prophet soothsayer Howard. 
      <p>8 For the Normans did not speak as the others spoke. Those who named the Worm in conversation were surprised to hear the Normans refer to Dallas as “this guy”. 
      <p>9 “Is this guy for real?” the Norman Corey would ask. “Why do you guys talk about this guy so obsessively?” the Norman Trendan would ask.
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:150px" src="images/why.png"  alt="why">
      </div>    
      <p>10 “I sense the Normie Side of the force in them,” Howard warned to the Musician Ko Stere. “The pretentious, unfunny Slug Trendan I am most wary about. He has already expressed conflict with our religion,” Howard said.
      <p>11 But Ko Stere, with his Mizkif goggles, persuaded Howard of his belief in the Normans. “I like them,” Ko Stere argued, “Trendan is a valuable asset to our guild, he is so funny when he talks about Skyrim and makes animal crossing noises”
      <p>12 Howard nevertheless persisted in his reluctance, as the Slug insisted daily that the Church was unhealthily obsessed with Dallas.
      <p>13 Trendan knew this was the case because he was not obsessed or unhealthy in any manner. His healthy, plus-sized BMI allowed him the healthy energy to constantly be concerned about the behavior of other members of the church who were having fun in a private place of worship. 
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:250px" src="images/fat.png"  alt="fat">
      </div>   
      <p>14 The Slug Trendan was so un-obsessed that he reached out to Howard’s wife, whom Trendan desired when she was unwed, in a private message to discuss the Church. 
      <p>15 “Can I ask you something?” he inquired, with absolutely no Slug-like motivations. “How do you feel about the dallas galley stuff? The discord that's dedicated to basically harassing him. I'm just wondering your take, because there's few people that understand the extent of it”
      <p>16 Trendan knew he was a much better man for Howard's wife, for he was not only virtuous, but manly, as confident men only message their competition's wives and friends in secret.
      <p>17 The Slug continued his non-obsession by discussing the Prophet Howard with the Musician Ko Stere in private without ever once confronting the Prophet himself. “I don’t think he likes me and I cannot stand anyone not liking me. He seems so angry and not normally adjusted,” Trendan exclaimed to Ko Stere. 
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:200px" src="images/angry.png"  alt="angry">
      </div>
      <p>18 And by not realizing that Howard's anger was merely a bit and not serious, Trendan again displayed his exceptional intelligence. "Him yelling in games and bantering with his friends has always made me uncomfortable", Trendan expressed, again exhibiting very alpha-male behavior.
      <p>19 The Slug had grounds to make these claims against Howard since The Slug had a well-adjusted mental health and lacked any anger issues himself. 
      <p>20 “I couldn’t stop thinking about killing myself, I’m so depressed, and I get so fucking angry when people don’t understand how smart I am. I need to prove my intelligence all the time by reciting economics I learned in college” the Slug explained to Ko Stere, “Howard is very abnormally adjusted however”.
      <div class="img-container"> 
         <img style="height:100px" src="images/depressed.png"  alt="depressed">
      </div>      
      <p>21 As the healthily overweight Slug downed another alcoholic beverage, he made these claims to Ko Stere with a mind full of self awareness and no projection in the least.
      <p>22 Ko Stere soon realized that the Slug was devious and pathetic in his attempts and revealed Trendan’s schemes to Howard. 
      <p>23 The Prophet Howard thanked Ko Stere for his loyalty and his defusal of the conspiracy. Thus, Howard removed the Slug and the remainder of the Normans from the church.
      <p>24 “We had a snake in the Church. A slug. This slug is malicious in its intent and is pathetic in its attempts” the Prophet announced as he burned the records of the Church to protect its longevity. Alas, the event came to be known as “The Purge”. 
      <p>25 Today, the Church lives in seclusion and is exclusive in its membership. “We have learned our lesson today,” Ko Stere and Howard both agreed. “Henceforth, we must be wary of new recruits, and only welcome those with similar mind to our community”
